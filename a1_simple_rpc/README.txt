 To run the simple RPC program, do the following:
    - In a terminal, run 'make rpc'.
    - Start the server by running './backend <host_ip> <host_port>'.
    - Start the client in another terminal by running './frontend <host_ip> <host_port>'.
    - Type something in the client terminal and hit enter. You will see the responses show up on the server's stdout.
    - To stop the program, enter the message 'quit' in the client terminal.
    - Run 'make clean' to remove the executables.
